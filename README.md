# NativeUI Plugin for NativePHP Mobile

A NativePHP Mobile plugin

## Installation

```bash
composer require nativephp/mobile-ui
```

## Usage

```php
use Native\Mobile\UI\Facades\NativeUI;

// Execute functionality
$result = NativeUI::execute(['option1' => 'value']);

// Get status
$status = NativeUI::getStatus();
```

## Listening for Events

```php
use Livewire\Attributes\On;

#[On('native:Native\Mobile\UI\Events\NativeUICompleted')]
public function handleNativeUICompleted($result, $id = null)
{
    // Handle the event
}
```

## Theming & Colors

Theme tokens live in `config/native-ui.php` (publish with
`php artisan vendor:publish --tag=native-ui-config`). Every authored color —
theme tokens, element color props, and arbitrary-value classes — accepts the
same grammar:

```php
'light' => [
    'primary'   => 'violet-600',      // Tailwind palette name
    'secondary' => 'fuchsia-500/70',  // opacity modifier → tonal fill
    'surface'   => '#F8FAFC',         // plain hex (#RGB / #RRGGBB)
    'accent'    => '#00AAA680',       // CSS alpha hex (#RRGGBBAA)
],
```

Alpha hex is authored in CSS `#RRGGBBAA` order; the framework converts to the
native wire format. Dark mode is auto-derived from `light` (alpha preserved)
unless a `dark` block overrides specific tokens.

Disabled controls draw from the `surface-variant` (fill) and
`on-surface-variant` (label) tokens on both platforms — adjust those two
tokens to tune disabled contrast app-wide.

Icons accept platform enum overrides in Blade, matching the fluent API:

```blade
<native:icon :ios="Ios::House" :android="Android::Home" :size="24" />
```

## Accessibility

Every element accepts a screen-reader label and an optional hint, via Blade
attributes (`a11y-label` / `a11y-hint`, or the camelCase spellings
`a11yLabel` / `a11yHint`) or the fluent API (`->a11yLabel()` / `->a11yHint()`).
The label maps to `accessibilityLabel` on iOS and `contentDescription` on
Android; the hint maps to `accessibilityHint` on iOS and is appended to the
content description on Android.

```blade
<native:button icon="trash" a11y-label="Delete draft" a11y-hint="Deletes the draft permanently" @press="deleteDraft" />
```

```php
use Native\Mobile\UI\Elements\Button;

Button::make()
    ->icon('plus')
    ->a11yLabel('Add item')
    ->a11yHint('Adds a new item to the list')
    ->onPress('addItem');
```

Always set `a11y-label` on icon-only buttons, chips, and tabs — without
visible text there is nothing for VoiceOver / TalkBack to announce. Icons are
decorative (silent to screen readers) unless given an `a11y-label`. List items
with a trailing icon button take `trailing-a11y-label` (fluent:
`->trailingA11yLabel()`) to label that button separately from the row.

## Text input icon colors

Outlined and filled text inputs accept independent colors for their leading
and trailing icons. Values use the same color grammar as other element props.
The regular color is also used in dark mode unless a `dark-*` companion is set:

```blade
<native:outlined-text-input
    label="Email"
    leading-icon="email"
    leading-icon-color="amber-600"
    dark-leading-icon-color="amber-300"
    trailing-icon="check"
    trailing-icon-color="#0F766E"
/>
```

The fluent equivalents are `leadingIconColor()`, `darkLeadingIconColor()`,
`trailingIconColor()`, and `darkTrailingIconColor()`. These overrides affect
only their icon slot, retain disabled-state attenuation, and do not tint the
loading indicator that replaces a trailing icon.

## Caret & Selection Reporting

> **Requires** `nativephp/mobile` 4.0+, which ships the `text_selection`
> callback kind — already enforced by this package's composer constraint.

The text inputs (`<native:bare-text-input>`, `<native:outlined-text-input>`,
`<native:filled-text-input>`) can report caret position and text selection back
to PHP via `@selectionChange`. The handler receives the current text plus the
selection range:

```php
public function onCaretMove(string $text, int $selectionStart, int $selectionEnd)
{
    // $selectionStart === $selectionEnd when the caret is a plain cursor;
    // they differ when a range of text is selected.
}
```

Offsets are **Unicode code points** into the text (not UTF-16 units or bytes),
so emoji and other astral characters count as one — safe to feed straight into
`mb_substr(..., encoding: 'UTF-8')`.

```blade
<native:outlined-text-input
    label="Message"
    @selectionChange="onCaretMove"
    selection-debounce-ms="100"
/>
```

```php
use Native\Mobile\UI\Elements\OutlinedTextInput;

OutlinedTextInput::make()
    ->label('Message')
    ->onSelectionChange('onCaretMove')
    ->selectionDebounceMs(100);
```

Events are coalesced on the native side — by default at most one every **150ms**
while the caret moves (the trailing position always fires). Tune the window per
input with `selection-debounce-ms` / `selectionDebounceMs` (fluent:
`->selectionDebounceMs()`); when unset, nothing is serialized and the renderer
default applies. A value of `0` (or less) also means "use the default"; positive
values are floored at one frame (16ms).

> **Every event carries the full current text**, and every event costs a bridge
> frame plus a full component re-render. That is independent of the
> `native:model` sync mode: pairing `@selectionChange` with `native:model.blur`
> or `.debounce` still ships the field contents to PHP on the selection
> cadence, not the model cadence. Budget the debounce window accordingly.

`@selectionChange` is never emitted for `secure` inputs. The callback is not
serialized at all when `secure` is set, and both renderers additionally refuse
to emit — so caret telemetry can't leak password-field context.

### Contract details

- **Programmatic value pushes.** When PHP pushes a new `value` onto the input,
  the field is replaced wholesale and the caret drops at the end. Both platforms
  report that immediately as a single `(text, length, length)` event, bypassing
  the debounce. A handler that rewrites the bound model will therefore see one
  follow-up event.
- **Discontiguous selections** (multi-range, iOS) are reported as a single span
  from the lowest start to the highest end — the reported range covers the gaps,
  so `mb_substr($text, $start, $end - $start)` includes text the user did not
  select.
- **`read-only` inputs** report selection on Android (which keeps them focusable
  for copy) but not on iOS (where read-only implies disabled, so the field never
  focuses).

A typical use is typeahead / mention triggers, where `@change` alone can't tell
you *where* the user is typing:

```php
public function onCaretMove(string $text, int $start, int $end)
{
    // Look backwards from the caret for an "@mention" trigger.
    $before = mb_substr($text, 0, $start, 'UTF-8');

    if (preg_match('/@(\w*)$/u', $before, $m)) {
        $this->showMentionSuggestions($m[1]);
    } else {
        $this->hideMentionSuggestions();
    }
}
```

## Date & Time Pickers

`<native:date-picker>` wraps SwiftUI's `DatePicker` and Material 3's
`DatePicker` / `TimePicker` behind one API.

```blade
<native:date-picker
    label="Appointment"
    mode="datetime"
    native:model="appointmentAt"
    min="2026-01-01"
    max="2026-12-31"
    timezone="Europe/Berlin"
    locale="de-DE"
    @change="appointmentChanged"
/>
```

```php
use Native\Mobile\UI\Elements\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make()
    ->label('Appointment')
    ->mode('datetime')
    ->value($this->appointmentAt)   // string or any DateTimeInterface
    ->min('2026-01-01')
    ->timezone('Europe/Berlin')
    ->locale('de-DE')
    ->onChange('appointmentChanged');
```

### The value contract

Values cross the bridge as **wall-clock ISO 8601 strings with no offset**,
shaped by `mode`:

| mode | wire value | example |
|---|---|---|
| `date` (default) | `Y-m-d` | `2026-07-25` |
| `time` | `H:i`, always 24-hour | `14:30` |
| `datetime` | `Y-m-d\TH:i` | `2026-07-25T14:30` |

No UTC conversion ever crosses the bridge. That is deliberate: it is what
keeps the classic off-by-one-day bug out of the element. Android's
`DatePickerState` reports UTC-midnight epoch millis and SwiftUI's `DatePicker`
binds an instant, so each renderer converts on its own side against one
agreed calendar — neither ever ships an instant.

`value`, `min`, and `max` accept an ISO string *or* any `DateTimeInterface`
(Carbon included), and a value finer than the mode needs is truncated — so a
`datetime` column can drive a date-only picker without reformatting:

```php
->mode('date')->value('2026-07-25T14:30:59Z')   // serializes as 2026-07-25
```

An empty string clears the selection; an unparseable one throws.

### Timezones and internationalization

`timezone` takes an IANA identifier and names **the calendar the picker
operates in** — what "today" means for an empty picker, and on iOS the
calendar used to convert between the bound instant and the wall-clock string.
It does *not* shift the wire value. Set it when your app pins a business
timezone instead of following the device; leave it unset to follow the device.

`locale` takes a BCP-47 tag and drives **display only** — month and weekday
names, weekday order, and the default clock convention. It never changes the
wire value, and the wire formatter is pinned to a Gregorian POSIX calendar so
a Buddhist- or Japanese-era locale can't leak a non-Gregorian year onto the
bridge.

`hour-format` (`auto` | `12` | `24`) overrides the clock convention. `auto`
resolves from the locale on **both** platforms — Android asks
`getBestDateTimePattern(locale, "jm")` rather than reading the device's
24-hour system setting, so the same `locale` gives the same result either
side.

### Display styles

`picker-style` picks the presentation, mapped to the nearest native idiom.
(It is not called `display` — that name is already flex/layout display on every
element.)

| `picker-style` | iOS | Android |
|---|---|---|
| `compact` (default) | `.compact` — tap to popover | trigger field + modal dialog |
| `inline` | `.graphical` — embedded calendar | embedded picker |
| `wheel` | `.wheel` — drum | **no drum in Material**; falls back to embedded |

### Platform notes

- `title`, `confirm-label`, and `cancel-label` are **Android only** — iOS
  commits on selection and has no dialog chrome to label. They are still
  user-visible strings, so pass translated values: `->confirmLabel(__('Done'))`.
- On iOS with `picker-style="compact"` and no value, a placeholder trigger stands
  in until first tap, because SwiftUI's compact picker always renders a
  concrete date and has no empty state.
- With `picker-style="inline"` and no initial value, neither platform commits the
  seeded "today" — you get a change event only once the user actually picks.
- `a11y-label` / `a11y-hint` are plumbed on both platforms; the current
  selection is additionally announced as the control's accessibility value.
- **`min` / `max` are rejected for `mode="time"`.** Neither platform can
  enforce a time-of-day range — SwiftUI's `in:` bounds an absolute instant, and
  Material 3's `TimePicker` has no bounds API — so passing them throws rather
  than silently doing nothing. Validate the chosen time in your component.
- **`picker-style="inline"` falls back to compact for `mode="time"` on iOS.**
  SwiftUI's `.graphical` style is date-only. Android embeds the time picker as
  asked.
- **Sync-mode modifiers are rejected.** A picker commits discretely, so
  `native:model.blur` / `native:model.debounce.300ms` have nothing to defer;
  they throw. Use plain `native:model`.

### Testing

The plugin registers picker vocabulary on the test harness, so screens read in
picker terms rather than raw select-change plumbing:

```php
Native::visit('/booking')
    ->pickDate('startsOn', '2026-12-24')
    ->pickTime('opensAt', new DateTimeImmutable('18:05'))
    ->pickDateTime('appointment', '2027-03-01T07:45')
    ->clearPicker('deadline')
    ->assertPicker('Starts', 'date')
    ->assertPickerValue('Starts', '2026-12-24')
    ->assertPickerEmpty('Deadline');
```

The `pick*` macros take an ISO string *or* any `DateTimeInterface` and
normalize to the wire shape for that mode before dispatching, so a test using
a Carbon instance or a full timestamp still sends exactly what the renderer
would. `assertPicker*` match on the picker's `label`.

Macros register only under a test runner, and only on a core whose
`TestableComponent` is macroable — the same `method_exists` gate the camera
plugin uses for its `FakeBridge` macros.

## Testing

Theme normalization and config write-back are pure PHP — no device, emulator,
or bridge round-trip required. `Theme::load()` / `Theme::merge()` resolve
authored color tokens (Tailwind names, `red-300/20` opacity modifiers, CSS
`#RRGGBBAA` alpha hex) to wire-format hex, auto-derive a dark block, and mirror
the effective set into `config('native-ui.theme.…')`. You can assert every step
of that in a unit test:

```php
use Illuminate\Config\Repository;
use Illuminate\Container\Container;
use Native\Mobile\UI\Theme;

it('normalizes tokens and mirrors them into config', function () {
    Container::getInstance()->instance('config', new Repository);

    try {
        Theme::load([
            'light' => ['primary' => 'red-300', 'accent' => '#8B5CF680'],
            'dark'  => ['primary' => 'red-800'],
        ]);

        // Normalized tokens are readable via Theme::get('mode.token'):
        expect(Theme::get('light.primary'))->toBe('#FCA5A5');   // palette name
        expect(Theme::get('light.accent'))->toBe('#808B5CF6');  // CSS alpha → wire ARGB

        // …and mirrored back so core's theme() helper reads wire-format hex:
        expect(config('native-ui.theme.light.primary'))->toBe('#FCA5A5');
        expect(config('native-ui.theme.dark.primary'))->toBe('#991B1B');
    } finally {
        Container::setInstance(null);
    }
});
```

Element color and typography props share the same grammar and serialize the
same way. Elements expose `toArray(new CallbackRegistry)` (via
`NativeElementCollector`), so you can assert what lands on the wire:

```php
use Native\Mobile\Edge\CallbackRegistry;
use Native\Mobile\UI\Elements\Button;

it('serializes typography props on an element', function () {
    $props = Button::make('Save')->font('Inter-Bold')->toArray(new CallbackRegistry)['props'];

    expect($props['font_name'])->toBe('Inter-Bold');
});
```

### Keeping `Theme::pushToNative()` off the wire

`Theme::load()` / `merge()` fire a `NativeUI.Theme.Set` bridge call on every
change. In a full Laravel test app, `pushToNative()`'s `runningUnitTests()`
guard suppresses it. In **plain Pest** (no booted app), that guard can't trip,
so mute the bridge in `beforeEach()` — the same pattern the plugin's own tests
use — and `reset()` between tests:

```php
use Native\Mobile\JumpBridge;
use Native\Mobile\UI\Theme;

beforeEach(function () {
    JumpBridge::instance()->mute();
    Theme::reset();
});

afterEach(fn () => Theme::reset());
```
